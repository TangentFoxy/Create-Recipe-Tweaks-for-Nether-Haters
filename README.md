# Create-Recipe-Tweaks-for-Nether-Haters
Simple datapack modifying recipes using Create+ mods to reduce nether travel requirements.

## Required Mods
- [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)
  - [Create Crafts & Additions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/createaddition)

## Recipes
The goal is to make nether travel more optional, by adding secondary more difficult recipes to avoid going there.

- 1x iron bar, 1x gold block, 2x blaze rod, 1x empty blaze burner -> 1x blaze burner
- mixing: 1x zinc ingot, 1x copper ingot, 1x fire charge -> 5x brass nugget
- mixing: 1x zinc ingot, 1x copper ingot, 1x firework star -> 2x brass nugget
- 3x brass rod, 6x cinder flour -> 2x blaze rod
- mixing: 1x iron nugget, 1x bone block, 1 bucket water -> 2x ghast tear

I also felt that the default rails recipe isn't good enough, so I changed it:
- 6x iron rod, 1x planks -> 32x rail
